# Aircrack-ng Cheatsheet üöÄ

Aircrack-ng is a comprehensive toolkit for auditing wireless networks. This cheatsheet outlines the key tools and usages.

## 1. Airmon-ng ‚öôÔ∏è

Puts your wireless card into monitor mode for packet sniffing.

```bash
airmon-ng start wlan0
```

- Initializes monitor mode on `wlan0`
- Generates a virtual monitor interface, typically named `wlan0mon`

**To stop monitor mode:**

```bash
airmon-ng stop wlan0mon
```

---

## 2. Airodump-ng üì°

Captures raw 802.11 packets and displays information about nearby wireless networks.

**To capture all packets:**

```bash
airodump-ng wlan0mon
airodump-ng wlan1 --band a //This will scan through 5ghz
```

**For a specific network:**

```bash
airodump-ng -c [channel] --bssid [BSSID] -w [filename] wlan0mon
```

- `-c`: Channel to listen on
- `--bssid`: BSSID of the target network
- `-w`: Specifies the output file prefix

Airodump-ng captures and displays:

- BSSID, SSID, channel
- Encryption type
- MAC addresses of connected clients
- IVs captured

---

## 3. Aireplay-ng üí•

Used for injecting frames to generate traffic, aiding in the cracking process.

**To deauthenticate a connected client:**

```bash
aireplay-ng -0 1 -a [BSSID] -c [client MAC] wlan0mon
```

- `-0`: Deauthentication mode
- `1`: Number of deauth packets
- `-a`: BSSID of the target network
- `-c`: Client MAC address

---

## 4. Aircrack-ng üîì

Cracks WEP and WPA keys.

**To crack a WEP key:**

```bash
aircrack-ng -a 1 -b [BSSID] [capture.cap]
```

**For WPA/WPA2 with dictionary attack:**

```bash
aircrack-ng -a 2 -b [BSSID] -w [dictionary.txt] [capture.cap]
```

- `-w`: Specifies the dictionary file for passphrase cracking

---

## 5. Conversion to .pcapng ‚öôÔ∏è

To convert `.cap` files generated by `airodump-ng` to `.pcapng`, use `tshark`.

```bash
tshark -r [input.cap] -w [output.pcapng]
```
